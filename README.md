# List of ISO 3166-1 country codes with translations

I had the need of a list of countries based on the _ISO 3166-1_ standard, as well the translated name of the countries (in french, spanish, german and dutch).

The data also includes the alpha-3 codes, the numeric codes of the countries, and a label I created (not based on any standard) that follows this convention : `<ISO 3166-1 alpha-2> - <Country name>`.

The JSON file uses the _ISO 3166-1 alpha-2_ code as keys.

**Note**: aggregating the data with translations was bit complicated, so it is possible the data isn't 100% accurate.
